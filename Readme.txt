Place the cfg folder into a sub folder of your choice in your tf2's custom directory. Note to linux users, the subfolder can't have a space or capital letter in it.

What will this config do?
	This config is set up so that it will be easy to change between fps configs and or override fps configs. That's not all it will do though, it will rebind based on class with some of my personal binds that I have come up with, note the config assumes you have a full keyboard and a 5 button mouse. I have also made it so that none of the class specific configs carry over to any other class, this is accomplished by calling a script that wipes the slate clean each time a new class is selected.

Alright what are these changes that you have set up?
	I'll go over the changes that effect all classes right off the bat, the first one you will notice is that I have changed it so that all jumps are now crouch jumps, I don't think there is ever a reason not to crouch jump so I made it one button push, simple and easy. Another thing I have changed is when you press tab to pull up the scores you will get information on your connection and frame rate for the current server you are on. Voice has been moved from v to mouse 4. v has also been changed to +attack3, which is basicly mvm stuff such as the medic shield and heavy knock back rage. F1-F4 now swap between loadout presets, and I have moved the mvm ready up to f9. F10 will disconnect you without asking. F11 is a sort of fix graphical issues, it will fix huds being the wrong color, players being stuck in high-five position and floating hats.

You mentioned class specific configs?
	Some classes get move out of scripting then other classes, I will go over each class and what I changed for them.

1. Scout
	No changes.

2. Soldier
	No changes.

3. Pyro
	No changes.

4. Demoman.
	Holding shift rebinds a and d to turning left and right, giving you better control of turning when you charge as a demoman (unpatched as of 3/31/14)

5. Heavy
	No changes.

6. Medic
	Holding shift will force auto callout from all nearby teammates.

7. Engineer
	Holding shift and pressing mouse 2 will destroy your old sentry and bring up a new one to be built, useful for minisentries
	1 on the keypad will destroy and bring up a new sentry to be built
	3 on the keypad will destroy and bring up a new dispenser
	7 on the keypad will destroy and bring up a new teleporter entrance.
	9 on the keypad will destroy and bring up a new teleporter exit.

8. Sniper
	No changes.

9. Spy
	Keypad has been changed to a quick disguise menu, 1 is scout 9 is spy, you get the picture. 
	Keypad 0 will disguise you as a friendly pyro. Useful for the dead ringer.
	q has been changed to only swap between the knife and the revolver.
	sapper has been moved to f
	last disguise has been moved to v
	inspecting players has been moved to b
	also worth noting when you use the sapper q will pull up the revolver. This is by design
	Auto reload is also been turned off for the spy.

Now this config will change a lot of settings, but I think I have labeled and explained what each script is doing so it shouldn't be to hard to change to your liking.
